Just testing nested forms with symfony 6.4.

I didn't make a Toys CRUD, so you need to create your toys in the DB.

Other then that, you can create Owners with pets. Each pets can have multiple Toy boxes and each boxes has a set of given toys (from the Toys list).

-update 2024-06-16: added LiveComponent to validate form with ajax
